## About The Project

Kanban is a common framework for agile and DevOps software development that provides transparency of work and team capacity. Kanban boards in Jira Software help teams visualize their workflow, limit work-in-progress, and maximize efficiency.

Why did we choose to create this system? Here's why: 
* Our system will allow teams to define and configure workflows and can be as simple or as complex as needed.
* Kanban boards will let teams know where work stands at a glance by displaying the most relevant information for each story, issue, bug, or task.
* The Kanban Board empowers teams and help streamline processes to identify bottlenecks before they happen, so every project launches on time.

Our main goal for this project is to increase overall efficiency and to proper visualize Project Management Concepts taught to us during course LBYPD2 and SOFDESG.
